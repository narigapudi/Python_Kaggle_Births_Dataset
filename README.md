# Python_Kaggle_Births_Dataset
## Goal: Analyze open source data about United States births in Python
### The 'US Births by Year, State, and Education Level of Mother: 2016-2021' (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danbraswell/temporary-us-births) was found on Kaggle, and it is sourced from the CDC. This analysis aimed to look at different aspects of the data, with a particular focus on birth weight, mother's education level, and mother's age. A second data set, 'United States, Females At Birth, Difference Female-Male (Years)' (https://data.nasdaq.com/data/OECD/HEALTH_STAT_EVIEFE00_EVIFHOEV_USA-united-states-females-at-birth-difference-femalemale-years) from Quandle was used to analyze time-series data about birth rates from 1960-2022.
